<br>- ⚡ About me: 
  
<h4 align="left"><p style="text-align: justify">**I love developing my skills and learning new things.
  For this reason, I started to learn programming using the Python language.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">While learning programming I liked it a lot, so much so that I thought about changing my career path. Encountering errors and problems while programming motivates me to solve them, and finishing a working script makes me extremely happy.</p>

<br>Worked with:
<br>- Python 3.x
<br>- Django 3.x
<br>- HTML
<br>- GIT
<br>
<br>Other module:
<br>Pygame, matplotlib, plotly, os.path, requests, BeautifulShop, selenium, OPENPYXL, PyPDF2, python-docx, JSON, csv, time, datatime, SMTP, pillow, pyautogui
<br>
<br>Other: Linux, Bash, PyCharm.
<br>
<br>My goal:
<br>- Back-End (Python) Developer or Software Tester
<br>
<br>I am currently learning: application testing using Robot Framework module. I am interested in Machine Learning and AI.
<br>
<br>I am comfortable working with Linux operating system and terminal writing simple scripts (Bash). I am looking to start a career as a software developer or tester using the Python language.
<br>
<br>Also:

<br><p style="text-align: justify">I am a professional mechanical engineer.
<br>I love the complexity and beauty of engineering. I like challenges and learning new things. I try my best to understand the problems I am solving. I'm always looking for a challenge. I love solving difficult problems and learning new things at the same time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Currently, I want to connect my professional career with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Python. For this reason, I attend trainings, read literature and carry out practical projects in the comfort of my home.
<br>
<br>Privately, a lover of cosmos space, sports (bike, hiking) and dog (currently I have a White Swiss Shepard named Riko).**</p></h4>
